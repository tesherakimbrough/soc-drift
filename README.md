**SOC Drift** is a personal ambient audio and visual experience built for cybersecurity professionals — especially Threat Analysts, SOC Analysts, and Security Technologists who work best at night. Inspired by real tools and projects:

- 🛡️ **HavenAI Secure** – Privacy-first AI threat detection
- 🔎 **ThreatLens** – Analyst-friendly log investigation toolkit

The goal? Create a sensory space that helps reduce burnout and bring a little calm to alert fatigue.
